    <h1>HTML5 Fractal Playground 1.3, May 17, 2014</h1>
    <p>
        I have had some more time to tinker with and tune my "HTML5 Fractal Playground" project.  My newer work mostly focuses on the user interface,
        though I did add two new iterating functions.        
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            I moved most of the options into a jQuery-UI dialog.  I provide buttons for most common operations along with keyboard shortcuts.
        </li>
        <li>
            I added a [Fullscreen] button that allows the application to run fullscreen with HTML5.
        </li>
        <li>
            I added another open-source library called "core-estimator".  This library estimates the number of cores in your CPU to optimize the
            parallel computations.  The only drawback is that it takes a while to load, especially with Internet Explorer.
        </li>
        <li>
            I added an experimental hash URL system that allows for specific locations within a fractal to be bookmarked.  However, please don't count
            on URLs in this version to work with future versions.  I might need to change something to add new functionality.  Please consider this
            feature experimental for the time being.
        </li>
        <li>
            With the hash URL syntax, you should be able to use the back button in the browser to return to a previously drawn fractal.
            There is a known issue with this: you must wait for each fractal to draw, or else the program will try to draw two fractals at once.
            I expect to fix this in the next version.
        </li>
    </ul>

        Assuming that a future version doesn't change the hash URL syntax, you can click on the pictures below to draw them in HTML5 Fractal Playground.
