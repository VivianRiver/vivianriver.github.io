    <h1>HTML5 Fractal Playground 2.3, August 30, 2014</h1>
    <p>
        Much progress has been made since version 2.0.  The codebase is becoming more mature. :-)
    </p>

    <p>
        In version 2.1.1, I added functionality to us HTML5 local storage to remember the estimated number of cores in the CPU between sessions.
        I also fixed an issue where the selected region is off a little bit to the side.
    </p>

    <p>
        In version 2.2, I finally added the functionality to select the colors used to draw the fractals.
    </p>

    <p>
        In version 2.3.0, I added functionality to select the region to zoom in on with touch.  It's very nice, but doesn't work in all browsers.  In 2.3.2,
        I use an experimental library to make the program backwards-compatible with MS IE's non-standard "pointer events".  I still don't recommend using IE
        with this program (or any other for that matter!); the Javascript performance is abysmal.
    </p>

    <p>
        In version 2.3.1, I did a major code clean-up with jslint.
    </p>

    <p>
        Looking to the future, I want to expand on the functions that the mathematics engine supports.  I also intend to add some unit tests.  It's tough working on
        an open-source project on the side!
    </p>
